This is the second iteration of my personal website. It doubles as a personal blog for those who want to clone it to their computer.

There is admin functionality built in to create and manage posts. You will have to create an admin in the console and log in through 'localhost:3000/admins/sign_in' to manage your posts. 

Ruby on Rails 5 and Bootstrap 4 were used to create this.
